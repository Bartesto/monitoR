River surfer plots}
\usage{
canning_surfR(path, obac, onic)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string filepath to location of sonde data xlsx
workbooks.}

\item{obac}{Character string ("green", "blue" or "red") indicating
oxygenation plant status at site BAC.}

\item{onic}{Character string ("green", "blue" or "red") indicating
oxygenation plant status at site NIC.}
}
\value{
A pdf format four panel surfer plot of the Canning River.
}
\description{
\code{canning_surfR} takes a file path to Canning River sonde output and creates
    a four panel (single column) surfer plot of salinity, dissolved oxygen,
    chlorophyll a, and temperature in pdf format. The function creates a
    folder called "plots" in the file path to store the pdf's. Code expects
    only 2 excel workbooks for one monitoring run.
}
\details{
Surfer plots display a
    cross-section of the river where the metrics of interest have been
    interpolated between sonde locations. Inverse distance weighting has
    been used for the interpolation.

A river "bottom" is displayed which puts the interpolation in context.
    The river bottom has been derived from a combination of historical
    maximum depths at sampling locations as well as station points extracted
    from a "best" navigation line over the latest corporate bathymetry. See
    project documentation for further details.
